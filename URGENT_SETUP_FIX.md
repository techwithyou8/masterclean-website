# 🚨 URGENT: API Key Setup Fix

## The Problem
Your Resend API key is currently in `.env.example` but the application can't read it from there. 

## The Solution

### Step 1: Create the Correct File
You need to create a file named `.env.local` (not `.env.example`) in the root directory of your project.

### Step 2: Copy Your API Key
1. Open your `.env.example` file
2. Copy the line that looks like: `RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key_here`
3. Create a new file called `.env.local` in the same directory
4. Paste the API key line into `.env.local`

### Step 3: File Structure Should Look Like This
\`\`\`
your-project/
├── .env.local          ← Your actual API key goes here (this file is used by the app)
├── .env.example        ← Example file (this is just a template, not used by the app)
├── package.json
├── next.config.mjs
└── ... other files
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Restart Development Server
After creating `.env.local`, restart your development server:
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

## Important Notes
- ✅ `.env.local` is used by the application
- ✅ `.env.example` is just a template/example
- ✅ `.env.local` should NOT be committed to git (it's in .gitignore)
- ✅ `.env.example` can be committed to git (it's safe, no real keys)

## Quick Fix Commands
If you're on Mac/Linux, you can run this in your terminal:
\`\`\`bash
# Copy the API key from .env.example to .env.local
cp .env.example .env.local
\`\`\`

If you're on Windows, you can run this in Command Prompt:
\`\`\`cmd
copy .env.example .env.local
\`\`\`

Then restart your development server with `npm run dev`.
