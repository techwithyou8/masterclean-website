# ðŸ“§ Email Setup Guide for MasterClean Website

## Current Issue
The contact form shows success messages but emails are not being received at info@mastercleanservice.nl because the previous implementation was only simulating email sending.

## Solution: Resend API Integration

### Step 1: Get Resend API Key

1. **Sign up for Resend** (if you haven't already):
   - Go to [https://resend.com](https://resend.com)
   - Create a free account (no credit card required)
   - Verify your email address

2. **Get your API key**:
   - Log into your Resend dashboard
   - Go to "API Keys" section
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Name it "MasterClean Website"
   - Copy the generated key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Create `.env.local` file** in your project root:
   \`\`\`env
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
   \`\`\`

2. **For production deployment** (Vercel/hosting):
   - Add `RESEND_API_KEY` as an environment variable
   - Use the same API key value

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run this command to install the Resend package:
\`\`\`bash
npm install resend
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Test the Setup

1. **Start your development server**:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

2. **Visit the test page**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/test-email`
   - Click "Check Email Configuration"
   - Verify that the configuration shows as "Ready"

3. **Send a test email**:
   - Fill out the test form
   - Click "Send Test Email"
   - Check info@mastercleanservice.nl for the email
   - Check the test email address for confirmation

### Step 5: Production Setup (Optional)

For production email sending with your own domain:

1. **Verify your domain** with Resend:
   - Add your domain in Resend dashboard
   - Add the required DNS records
   - Wait for verification

2. **Update the email configuration**:
   - Change the `from` address in `lib/actions.ts`
   - Use your verified domain (e.g., `noreply@mastercleanservice.nl`)
